        <h4>About Me:</h4>
        <p>Music has been my passion since I picked up a guitar at at the age of 6. I'm mostly self-taught and continuously strive to improve my skills on guitar, bass and drums. I began studying Music Performance in 2013, where I was a founding member of the band Deadweight (later known as Shingen). We went on to play numerous shows locally, and in 2014 we released the EP '<a href="http://deadweightuk.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Uprising</a>', which was recorded, mixed and mastered by myself. Throughout my studies, I also booked and promoted live shows under the name 'Black Kite Promotions'. This ran for several years, hosting many shows of varying sizes featuring artists both local and international.<br><br>
          
        After Shingen disbanded in 2016, I wrote music and performed with numerous bands including progressive metal group 'Gaia's Stone', math rock trio 'Lou Thesz Press' and black metal band 'Ecorcheur'. From here, I went into higher education studying Live Audio Engineering & Music Production at Spirit Studios in 2017 before taking a sabbatical in 2019 to work full time. I intend to resume my studies in September 2021. I currently play guitar for Stockport-based punk band 'Mint Acid'.</p>
